This javascript accepts text files and displays them as a 4x4 grid and four pole variables.

The text files must be saved in their coresponding folders (txtFiles, variableFiles)found in the main directory of this project.

The file names of the individual files are critical to the function of the program and should remain as they are in the template. 
all text inside the file may be replaced.
